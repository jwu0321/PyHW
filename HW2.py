Problem 1
Implement the rest of calculateTax to compute the price of an item after tax is applied to it. New York's tax rate
is 8.875%.
'''

def calculateTax(price):
# Your code here


'''
Problem 2
Write a function named computeHypotenuse that takes in two ints a, b in a right triangle and computes the length of the
hypotenuse.
'''

Problem 3
Write a function called distance that returns the Euclidean distance between two points. Its parameters should be 
x1, y1, x2, and y2. You should look up the distance formula if you forgot or don't know what it is. To test if your 
function works, I wrote a function that uses the distance formula to approximate pi. If your function is correct,
then you should get at least 3.141 plus or minus 0.001.

Problem 4
Write a function that determines whether a year is a leap year. There are two rules: the year has to be divisible by
4, unless it is a multiple of 100, where only years divisible by 400 are leap years. So, 2000 is a leap year, but 
1900 is not.
